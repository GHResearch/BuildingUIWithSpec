!! ListModel

!!! Registeredd Colors in background

Here is an example of a ==ListModel== with elements having different colors. The following code shows how to build a ==ListModel== containing all registered color names.

==#items:== set the elements of the list. ==#title==

For each color, the element holding the name of the color has the color in background. To do this, the message ==#backgroundColorBlock:== is used. It takes a block with a single parameter that is the item concerned by the background color.

[[[label=ex_registered_colors_list|caption=List of registerred colors|language=Smalltalk|
	| registeredColorsList |
	registeredColorsList := ListModel new.
	registeredColorsList
		items: Color registeredColorNames;
		backgroundColorBlock: [ :item | Color named: item];
		title: 'Registered colors'.
	registeredColorsList openWithSpec
]]]

!!! List of icons

In this example, we are going to build a list containing icons of the current theme and their respective selector using a subclass of ListModel : IconListModel.

==#displayBlock:== wrap your domain specific items and should return something that can be displayed in a list, like a String or a Text.

[[[label=ex_icon_list|caption=Icons List|language=Smalltalk|
	| iconList |
	iconList := IconListModel new.
	iconList
		items: Smalltalk ui icons allIconNames asSortedCollection;
		displayBlock: [ :selector | selector asString ];
		sortingBlock: [ :selectorA :selectorB | selectorA < selectorB ];
		icons: [ :each | Smalltalk ui icons iconNamed: each ];
		title: 'Availiable icons for the current theme.'.
	iconList openWithSpec
]]]

!! Reusing UI Element
@sec_reuse_spec

% Spirita : ModelList is confusing with ListModel, may it should be renamed WidgetList (SD's suggestion)


This section introduces an example of how to define and reuse ''Spec'' user interfaces. The example UI that is built will serve to browse the public API of all the basic widgets offered by ''Spec''. This API is further documented in Section *@sec_Meta_Informations*. In this section we do not detail the different parts of ''Spec'' yet,  for a more in-depth discussion on the heart of ''Spec''  we refer to Section *@sec_heart_of_spec*.

The example is structured in four parts that will result in the browser shown in figure *@fig_protocol_browser*.

- First, a ""WidgetList"" : a list UI dedicated to render the subclasses of the ''AbstractWidgetModel'' class.
- Second, a ""ProtocolList"" : an UI composed of a list and a label.
- Third, a ""ProtocolViewer"" : defined by combining a ""WidgetList"" with two ""ProtocolList"" to browse the ''api'' and ''api-events'' methods.
- Finally, a ""ProtocolBrowser"" is made by reusing a ""ProtocolViewer"" and adding a text zone. 

+A simple class browser composed of reusable elements.>file://figures/Protocol_Browser.png|width=80|label=fig_protocol_browser+









First we define the elements that compose the resulting browser. In the subsequent section we will add interaction between them. For example, what is happening when we select an element in the list.

SD: we should show the intermediate results we will get.

!!! The WidgetList

Creating a specific UI always starts with the subclassing of ""ComposableModel"".
Each sub widget is stored into an instance variable of the newly created class.
The snippet *@ex_widget_list* shows the definition of this for the ==WidgetList== class.




[[[label=ex_widget_list|caption=WidgetList definition|language=Smalltalk 
ComposableModel subclass: #WidgetList
	instanceVariableNames: 'list'
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'Spec-Examples'
]]]

The first required step then is to instantiate and define the sub widgets.
This step is done in the method ==initializeWidgets== as shown in the code *@ex_WidgetList_initializeWidgets*. It creates the list and populates it with the required classes, in alphabetical order.
More details on the use of the ==initializeWidgets== method are given in Subsection *@subsec_initializeWidgets*.

[[[label=ex_WidgetList_initializeWidgets|caption=Implementation of WidgetList>>initializeWidgets|language=Smalltalk 
WidgetList>>initializeWidgets

	list := self newList.
	list items: (AbstractWidgetModel allSubclasses 
		sorted: [:a :b | a name < b name ]).
	self focusOrder add: list
]]]

Note that ==newList== is a shortcut because lists are really used often. Its definition is the following one
[[[caption=Implementation of newList>>initializeWidgets|language=Smalltalk
ComposableModel>>newList
	^ self instantiate: ListModel
]]]





The second required step is to define a layout, which is done on the class side.
Since there is here only one sub widget, the layout is quite simple, as shown in the code *@ex_WidgetList_layout*.
It simply returns a layout that contains only the list.
More details on the use of this method are given in Subsection *@subsec_layout*.

[[[label=ex_WidgetList_layout|caption=WidgetList layout|language=Smalltalk 
WidgetList class>>defaultSpec
	<spec: #default>
	
	^ SpecLayout composed
		add: #list;
		yourself
]]]

Pay attention the argument, ==#list==, of the ==add:== message, refers to a method that we did not define yet and that should return the associated UI element (here a list). 


The three last methods to define on WidgetList are a getter, a method to display the UI title and a method to register to list selection changes.
The code *@ex_WidgetList_others* shows the implementation of these three methods and their protocols.

[[[label=ex_WidgetList_others|caption=WidgetList other methods|language=Smalltalk 
WidgetList>>list
	^ list

WidgetList>>title
	^ 'Widgets'

WidgetList>>whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock
	list whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock
]]]

Note that this ==whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock== will probably be deprecated in the future, since clients
can simply send the message to the list directly.

The first UI is now done.
The result can be seen by executing the following snippet of code: ==WidgetList new openWithSpec== as shown in figure *@fig_widget_list*

+The WidgetList Element.>file://figures/List.png|width=50|label=fig_widget_list+




!!! The ProtocolList

The next user interface that we will build is the protocol list.
This UI combines two widgets: a list and a label.
The class definition is similar to the code above, as can be seen in *@ex_protocolList_definition*.

[[[label=ex_protocolList_definition|caption=ProtocolList definition|language=Smalltalk 
ComposableModel subclass: #ProtocolList
	instanceVariableNames: 'label protocols'
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'Spec-Examples'
]]]

The ==initializeWidgets== method for this UI is quite similar to the method in WidgetList, as the code in *@ex_protocolList_init* shows.

[[[label=ex_protocolList_init|caption=ProtocolList implementation of initializeWidgets|language=Smalltalk 
ProtocolList>>initializeWidgets

	protocols := self newList.
	label := self newLabel.	
	label label: 'Protocol'.
	self focusOrder add: protocols
]]]


The layout method is quite different though.
Now the sub widgets need to be placed more specifically than in the previous example.
The code *@ex_protocolList_layout* shows how to build a column with the label on top and the list taking all the space that is left.

[[[label=ex_protocolList_layout|caption=ProtocolList layout|language=Smalltalk 
ProtocolList class>>defaultSpec
	<spec: #default>

	^ SpecLayout composed
		newColumn: [ :column |
			column
				add: #label
				height: self toolbarHeight;
				add: #protocols ];
		yourself
]]]

Note again that the arguments of the message ==add:== refer to methods that we will implement now. The remaining methods are getters, sub widget delegation methods, a method to display the title, and a method to register to list selection changes.
The code *@ex_protocolList_others* shows the implementations of these methods.

[[[label=ex_protocolList_others|caption=ProtocolList other methods|language=Smalltalk 
ProtocolList>>label
	^ label

ProtocolList>>protocols
	^ protocols

ProtocolList>>items: aCollection
	protocols items: aCollection
	
ProtocolList>>label: aText
	label text: aText
	
ProtocolList>>resetSelection
	protocols resetSelection
	
ProtocolList>>title
	^ 'Protocol widget'
	
ProtocolList>>whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock
	protocols whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock
]]]

Note again that the message ==whenSelectedItemChanged:== may be deprecated in the future.
We will see that the users may direcly register block using the accessors.

The ""ProtocolList"" UI can be seen by evaluating ==ProtocolList new openWithSpec==. As shown in Figure *@fig_protocollist*
the widgets is empty. This is normal since we did not initialize it. 

+The ProtocolList Element.>file://figures/EmptyProtocolList.png|width=50|label=fig_protocollist+


!!! The ProtocolViewer

The third user interface is a composition of the two previous user interfaces.
It is composed of a ""WidgetList"" and two ""ProtocolList"".
When a model class is selected, the methods in the protocol ''protocol'' and in the protocol ''protocol-events'' are listed.

The class has now three instance variables: ==models== to store the ""WidgetList"", ==protocols== to store the ""ProtocolList"" for the protocol ''protocol'', and ==events== to store the ""ProtocolList"" for protocol ''protocol-events''.
The code in *@ex_viewer_definition* shows the definition of the class ""ProtocolViewer"".

[[[label=ex_viewer_definition|caption=ProtocolViewer definition|language=Smalltalk 
ComposableModel subclass: #ProtocolViewer
	instanceVariableNames: 'models protocols events'
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'Spec-Examples'
]]]

The ==initializeWidgets== method now uses a different way to initialize the sub-widgets of the UI. 
This is because it does not use basic widgets but instead reuses the user interfaces we defined previously.
The remainder of the method is quite similar to the previous implementation, as shown in the code in *@ex_viewer_initializeWidgets*.

[[[label=ex_viewer_initializeWidgets|caption=Implementation of ProtocolViewer>>initializeWidgets|language=Smalltalk 
ProtocolViewer>>initializeWidgets

	models := self instantiate: WidgetList.
	protocols := self instantiate: ProtocolList.
	events := self instantiate: ProtocolList.
	
	protocols
		label: 'api';
		displayBlock: [ :m | m selector ].
	events
		label: 'api-events';
		displayBlock: [ :m | m selector ].
		
	self focusOrder 
		add: models;
		add: protocols;
		add: events
]]]

The layout puts the sub widgets in one column, with all sub widgets taking the same amount of space.
The code in *@ex_viewer_layout* shows the implementation of this layout.

[[[label=ex_viewer_layout|caption=ProtocolViewer column layout|language=Smalltalk 
ProtocolViewer class>>defaultSpec
	<spec: #default>
	
	^ SpecLayout composed
		newColumn: [ :column |
			column 
				add: #models; 
				add: #protocols; 
				add: #events ];
		yourself
]]]

To describe the interactions between the sub widgets, the method ==initializePresenter== needs to be defined.
Here, it specifies that when a class is selected, the selections in the protocol list are reset and both protocol lists are populated.
Additionally, when a method is selected in one protocol list, the selection in the other list is reset.
The implementation of this method is exposed in code *@ex_viewer_presenter*.
More details on the ==initializePresenter== method are given in *@subsec_initializePresenter*.

[[[label=ex_viewer_presenter|caption=ProtocolViewer sub widget interactions|language=Smalltalk
ProtocolViewer>>initializePresenter

	models whenSelectedItemChanged: [ :class |
		protocols resetSelection.
		events resetSelection.
		class
			ifNil: [ 
				protocols items: #().
				events items: #() ]
			ifNotNil: [ 
				protocols items: (self methodsIn: class for: 'api').
				events items: (self methodsIn: class for: 'api-events') ] ].
	
	protocols whenSelectedItemChanged: [ :method | method ifNotNil: [ self resetEventSelection ] ].
	events whenSelectedItemChanged: [ :method | method ifNotNil: [ self resetProtocolSelection ] ].
]]]

The remaining methods are getters, methods to delegate to sub widgets, one method to compute the methods in a specific class for a specific protocol, and methods to register to sub widget events.
Those methods are given in the code in *@ex_viewer_others*.

[[[label=ex_viewer_others|caption=ProtocolViewer other methods|language=Smalltalk 
	ProtocolViewer>>events
		^ events

	ProtocolViewer>>models
		^ models

	ProtocolViewer>>protocols
		^ protocols

	"private"
	ProtocolViewer>>methodsIn: class for: protocol
		^ (class methodsInProtocol: protocol) sorted: [ :a :b | a selector < b selector ]

	ProtocolViewer>>resetEventSelection
		events resetSelection

	ProtocolViewer>>resetProtocolSelection
		protocols resetSelection

	ProtocolViewer>>title
		^ 'Protocol viewer'

	ProtocolViewer>>whenClassChanged: aBlock
		models whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock

	ProtocolViewer>>whenEventChangedDo: aBlock
		events whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock

	ProtocolViewer>>whenProtocolChangedDo: aBlock
		protocols whenSelectedItemChanged: aBlock
]]]

As previously, the result can be seen by executing the following snippet of code: ==ProtocolViewer new openWithSpec==.

+The ProtocolViewer>file://figures/Protocol_Viewer.png|width=50|label=fig_protocol_Viewer+

!!! Protocol Browser
@subsec_protocol_browser

The last user interface reuses a ""ProtocolViewer"" with a different layout and adds a text zone to edit the source code of the selected method.
The class definition can be seen in code in *@ex_browser_definition*.

[[[label=ex_browser_definition|caption=ProtocolBrowser definition|language=Smalltalk 
ComposableModel subclass: #ProtocolBrowser
	instanceVariableNames: 'viewer text'
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'Spec-Examples'
]]]

The ==initializeWidgets== implementation is shown in the code in *@ex_browser_initializeWidgets*.

[[[label=ex_browser_initializeWidgets|caption=ProtocolBrowser>>initializeWidgets|language=Smalltalk 
initializeWidgets

	text := self newText.
	viewer := self instantiate: ProtocolViewer.
	text aboutToStyle: true.
	self focusOrder 
		add: viewer;
		add: text
]]]

The layout is more complex than the previous layouts.
Now the user interface mainly lays out widgets that are contained in its ==viewer== sub widget (the list of models and the two protocol browsers).
The layout is based on a column whose first row is divided in columns.
The implementation of this method is shown in code in *@ex_browser_layout*.

[[[label=ex_browser_layout|caption=ProtocolBrowser layout|language=Smalltalk 
defaultSpec
	<spec: #default>
	
	^ SpecLayout composed
		newColumn: [ :col | 
			col 
				newRow: [ :r | 
					r 
						add: #(viewer models);
					 	newColumn: [ :c | 
							c 
								add: #(viewer protocols);
								add: #(viewer events) ] ];
				add: #text
		];
		yourself
]]]

The ==initalizePresenter== method is used to make the text zone react to a selection in the lists.
When a method is seleted, the text zone updates its contents to show the source code  of the selected method.
The implementation of this method is detailled in the code in *@ex_browser_presenter*.

[[[label=ex_browser_presenter|caption=ProtocolBrowser interactions|language=Smalltalk 
ProtocolBrowser>>initializePresenter

	viewer whenClassChanged: [ :class | text behavior: class ].
	viewer whenProtocolChangedDo: [ :item | 
		item 
			ifNil: [ text text: '' ]
			ifNotNil: [ text text: item sourceCode ] ].
	viewer whenEventChangedDo: [ :item | 
		item 
			ifNil: [ text text: '' ]
			ifNotNil: [ text text: item sourceCode ] ]
]]]

The other methods are two getters, a method to set the default size, and a method to set the UI title.
Their implemenations are detailled in code *@ex_browser_others*.

[[[label=ex_browser_others|caption=ProtocolBrowser remaining methods|language=Smalltalk
	ProtocolBrowser>>text
		^ text

	ProtocolBrowser>>viewer
		^ viewer

	ProtocolBrowser>>initialExtent
		^ 750@600
	
	ProtocolBrowser>>title
		^ 'Protocols browser'
]]]

This finishes the protocol browser.
The final user interface can be opened with the following snippet: ==ProtocolBrowser new openWithSpec==.
The result can be seen in figure *@fig_second_protocol_browser*.
%spirita: an ancor named fig_protocol_browser already exists (its the same figure, give the same name create problems in reference).

may be this should be adding in the flow.
